# In this program we are going to see how to take inputs in python 2.7 and declair variables and lists

var=123      #Here we dirctly declair variables no need of data type
lists=[12,23,34]    #Here we creat alist of no same for float values and strings
inp=raw_input("Enter the input : ")

# Addition of variables
x=13
y=23
z=x+y
print "z="+z # Which is z=36

# Addition of lists
lis=["mahesh","IT"]
add=lists+lis
print add   # Which is [12,23,34,'mahesh','IT']
