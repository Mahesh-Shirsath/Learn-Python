# here we are goning to discuss about for loop

# in for loop we use the function name in range
# it work as range(initial,final,increment or decrement)

for i in range(0,9,1):
    print "i=",i

# here we doint get output as i=9 because in range function the final index is not taken

for i in range(0,9,2):
    print "i=",i
# Here we get all even no as output

for i in range(9,0,-1):
    print "i=",i
# here we get revese order as an output
